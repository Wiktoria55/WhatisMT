                                        <h1 style="text-align: center;font-family: Cambria;">Types of MT</h1>
                                        <p><span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: 13;">Machine translation technology has come a long way since its early days. Over time, several approaches have emerged, with three main models: Rule-based Machine Translation (RBMT), Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT), LLM.</span>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>1. Rule-Based Systems (RBMT) – the first commercially used machine translation systems were rule-based and emerged in the 1960s. These models relied on the idea that every language has a large set of grammatical, syntactic and semantic rules. Linguists painstakingly defined these rules for sentence structure, word order and phrasing in both the source and target languages. The system then generated sentences by matching source language words to dictionary entries: it verified each word to provide an adequate output. However, RBMT had several drawbacks:</p>
                                        <p>-	Long development – creating and maintaining rule sets for new languages was very time-consuming and required a lot of effort as the developers had to manually define and program a different set of rules for every new added language.</p>
                                        <p>-	Poor translation quality – the model generated translations that were full of errors,</p>
                                        <p>-	Heavy reliance on post-editing: Human translators needed to fix the machine’s mistakes by editing the translation.</p>
                                        <p>RBMT is rarely used today, however there are still platforms that incorporate this technology, such as Apertium.</p>
                                        <p>2. Statistical Machine Translation (1990s)</p>
                                        <p>The 1990s saw the rise of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) which – unlike RBMT does not rely on pre-defined rules. Instead, this model was based on statistical probabilities to choose among multiple translation options.Statistical methods and trained by analyzing large amounts of bilingual text corpus to learn associations between words in different languages. To produce translations, SMT finds equivalent expressions and defines how other similarly constructed texts should be translated into the target language.. Statistical approach offered significant improvements in translation quality, as SMT systems can handle ambiguity more effectively by considering the probability of different translations and therefore, require less post-editing.</p>
                                        <p>3. Neural Machine Translation</p>
                                        <p>The preceding models were outcompeted by a more advanced, probabilistic model known as neural machine translation (NMT) that relies on artificial neural networks, particularly deep learning architectures. These networks consist of an encoder and a decoder that mimic the neural processes of  human brains, they “encode” a source sentence into a “meaning vector,” while recognizing semantic relationships such as the association of the word “flower” with “rose,” “floral,” and “plants''. NMT works without segmenting the input into individual words or phrases. Instead, it utilizes sentence context to generate the most pertinent translation, mapping a sequence of words from the source language to its equivalent sequence in another language. The generated output is compared with the expected translation and necessary adjustments are made until the translation achieves grammatical correctness and human-like fluency. Neural networks require a lot of data to learn and execute tasks successfully. However, once fully trained, they continuously improve the quality and fluency of their output without human intervention. Such efficacy led Google to adopt NMT as its model, now used across various translation platforms, including DeepL, Systran, and Yandex.</p>
                                        <p>4. Large-scale language models based on transformer architectures like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) started to become popular around 2019. The first model GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, however while it could generate coherent text in response to prompts, it was not trained for translation. For this reason, its capabilities were not as sophisticated as in the later versions: GPT-2, GPT-3 or GPT-4. The newer models were trained on vast amounts of text data that allowed them to grasp language patterns and relationships between words. Large-scale pre-trained language models brought significant advancement to machine translation, the most important progress includes:</p>
                                        <p>-	The ability to translate with context - when prompted for translation, ChatGPT analyzes the text and tries to understand the meaning before generating its output in the target language. With additional information about the text’s purpose or origin, Chat GPT takes into consideration  the broader context of the input text that results in more accurate translations.</p>
