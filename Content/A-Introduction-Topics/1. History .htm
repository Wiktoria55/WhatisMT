                                        <h1>The history of machine translation</h1>
                                        <p>a)	Early days:</p>
                                        <p>The origins of translation machines date back to the 1930s. That is when, in 1933, an engineer Georges Artsrouni patented the first translation machine in history - his electronic multilingual dictionary, called “mechanical brain”. The device was able to print information and perform translations by substituting one word for another.</p>
                                        <p>[Image: (Corbé 1960)]</p>
                                        <p>Another scientist who worked on a similar invention at the same time was Petr Troyanskii. He created a translation device consisting of an inclined desk and a belt with protrusions moving along several axes. The belt was a large dictionary containing terms in six languages. To use this device, the operator would select a word from the source language and scroll to find a substitute in another language. Troyanskii’s invention was a breakthrough in automatic translations. However, due to Stalinist terror and the tense atmosphere in Soviet Russia - the use of foreign languages was frowned upon, so the discoverer did not gain fame during his lifetime.</p>
                                        <p>[Image: Trojanskii’s translating machine (1959)]</p>
                                        <p>b) 1950s-1970s:</p>
                                        <p>Twenty years later, on January 7, 1954, a widely reported Georgetown-IBM experiment took place. The aim of the experiment was to demonstrate the capabilities of machine translation. For this purpose, sentences from the domains of law, chemistry and metallurgy were entered in Russian language to be (in a few seconds) translated into English by an IBM 701 computer. It was a small-scale experiment as the computer had a system consisting of 250 words and 6 grammar rules, yet it gave hope that in the nearest future it would be possible to translate texts fully automatically. As a result of the extraordinary performance, the government decided to invest in the development of computer linguistics. However, as history has shown - the process of creating the perfectly usable machine translation tool was a lot slower than expected.</p>
                                        <p>The government-funded research into the development of MT was focused on the Russian-English and English-Russian language pairs and despite the efforts put into improving the technology, the output generated by the first MT systems contained many errors and allowed only a cursory understanding of the translated text. Due to the unsatisfactory results, the American government decided to convene ALPAC (Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee), whose purpose was to evaluate the progress. ALPAC published a report in which it assessed that:</p>
                                        <p>•	machine translations are very expensive,</p>
                                        <p>•	machines make more errors than human translators.</p>
                                        <p>The publication of the document was synonymous with the immediate cessation of financing for MT in the USA and – therefore, a significant slowdown in the development of this technology.</p>
                                        <p>Despite the failures, the demand for automatic translators continued to increase as users were ready to accept the poor-quality output for the sake of easy access to information. Some of the popular MT systems that provided translation to users, include:</p>
                                        <p>•	the METEO system (1954) capable of translating weather forecasts from English to French (it translated approximately 80,000 words per day).</p>
                                        <p>•	the Mark II (1957) system developed by IBM and Washington University, installed at the USAF Foreign Technology Division,</p>
                                        <p>•	Systran (1968) used by United States Air Force to translate Russian scientific articles into English,</p>
                                        <p>•	Logos (1960s-1970s) developed by the United States Department of Defense’s Advanced Research Project Agency to translate Russian military documents into English.</p>
                                        <p>d)         1980s-1990s:</p>
                                        <p>The 1980s and 1990s saw a diversity of approaches, with researchers exploring various methods to overcome the challenges of automatic translation. Rule-based systems (relying on linguistic rules and dictionaries) remained prominent, while statistical systems (learning from parallel corpora) began to gain popularity. The significant development of MT was driven by the increasing adoption of personal computers that gradually replaced mainframe machines. With the popularity of PCs, machine translation software transitioned from primarily serving translators to becoming accessible for personal use. This change led to the start of online translation services, such as:</p>
                                        <p>•	Babel Fish,</p>
                                        <p>•	Systran,</p>
                                        <p>•	FreeTranslation.com,</p>
                                        <p>•	WorldLingo.</p>
                                        <p>e)         2000s-2020s:</p>
                                        <p>In the 2000s, statistical machine translation models replaced the now rarely used rule-based models. Important advancements were made in speech translation, leading to the creation of many solutions for automatically translating parliamentary speeches and news broadcasts. This era also witnessed the expansion of MT into various domains such as:</p>
                                        <p>•	TV subtitles,</p>
                                        <p>•	Restaurant menus,</p>
                                        <p>•	Websites.</p>
                                        <p>The following decade brought about a revolutionary technology: neural machine translation (NMT), which supplanted statistical MT. First introduced in 2010, NMT went through several years of research before being launched by Baidu, called “the first large-scale NMT system.” Google followed suit in 2016 by transitioning from its main statistical MT engine to adapt the new NMT model.</p>
                                        <p>In 2017, the Transformer model was introduced, which showed superior performance compared to earlier versions. Since then, researchers have been training increasingly larger language models, such as BERT and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), on large amounts of text data. This has resulted in strong performance across many language tasks, including generation, comprehension and translation.</p>
                                        <p>There has also been a growing interest in multilingual and zero-shot translation, where models are trained to translate between different language pairs without language-specific training. It means that a single model can translate between multiple languages with minimal or no additional training data.</p>
                                        <p>Machine translation continues to be a subject of continuous research, with a focus on improving models, training methodologies and optimization techniques. These ongoing efforts contribute to advancements in translation quality and efficiency.</p>
